# test script checks if all the services used by the lab are running properly
# or not.
# This script also tests the backup and restore scripts in case the
# lab uses any data.
# Since Engineering Electro-magnetics Laboratory only needs Apache to run all the time,
# it will only check for status of Apache2 service.
# Usage of the Script

# To use test script, run the command
# ./scripts/test

# checks for the status of Apache service
status=$(service apache2 status)

#echo the test result
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then 
	echo "Test Passed!"
else
	echo "Test Failed!"
